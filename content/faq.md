### What is a Tornjak?

The name Tornjak (pronounced "tornyak") originates from the Tornjak mountain sheep dog breed native to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. The breed is commonly used for sheepherding. Since cloud native workloads are usually said to be treated as "cattle, not pets", the breed was an apt name for the management of these cattle!

### More about the Tornjak Project

The Tornjak project aims to provide a management plane and capabilities for SPIFFE identities managed by SPIRE. The goals are to provide global visibility, auditability, and configuration and policy management for identities. This can be thought about as a central management plane for identities across SPIRE servers, with the aim for use by an administrator or CISO to govern an organization's workload identities.
